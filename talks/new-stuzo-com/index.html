        <ul>
            <li>Split user stories (requirements) into tasks for developers.</li>
            <li>Guide task esimation process.</li>
            <li>Assign tasks to developers (and reassign them when needed).</li>
            <li>Make sure developers' tasks are completed properly.</li>
            <li>Make sure user story is implemented when tasks are completed.</li>
        </ul>
    </div></section>
    <section class="slide"><div>
        <h2>Let's give this role to one of the developers</h2>
        Because:
        <ul>
            <li>Developers better understand how to divide user story into tasks for developers.</li>
            <li>Developers better understand when specific task is complete.</li>
            <li>Developers better understand who among them is apt for the task at the moment.</li>
        </ul>
    </div></section>
    <section class="slide"><div>
        <h2>Advantages for PMs and QAs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>No need to dive into implementation. Deal only with user stories (requirements) and bugs.</li>
            <li>You have at least one person who knows all the parts of project's technical implementation (ideally). So you can ask them if you don't know who to ask.</li>
        </ul>
    </div></section>
    <section class="slide"><div>
        <h2>Advantages for developers</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>More flexibility in arranging work.</li>
            <li>Better understanding of a project on a higher level (not limited with a subset of tasks assigned to you by PM).</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="slide"><div>
        <h2>Differences</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Requirements are created by PM and assigned dev team lead.</li>
            <li>Developers split requirements into tasks.</li>
            <li>Dev team lead closes tasks resolved by developers.</li>
            <li>Dev team lead resolves user story when it's ready for QA.</li>
            <li>QA tests whole user story and creates bugs as subtasks of corresponding user stories.</li>
        </ul>
    </div></section>
    <section class="slide"><div>
        <h2>Experiment</h2>
        <p>I propose to conduct an experiment on 4 and 5 phase of Grammy 2014.</p>
        <p>It's relatively small amount of work so we won't screw up a lot.</p>
        <p>We'll try to work this way and see if it's better and what kind of problems we'll encounter.</p>
